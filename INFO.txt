	-Python Cryptography Toolkit (Version 2.0.1):
		Homepage: http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto

Functionalities to be added:
	
	-Check if filenames provided exist/overwrite something else
	-GUI?
	-Check the memory footprint to veryfy if a key could be harvested from memory after an encode/decode
	XXPriorityXX -Have the program output at the same place as the input file (or bin file)
	-Check to header to know if it has to encode or decode the file

This program is useful because:
	-Unlike TrueCrypt (which is otherwise excellent), it can be run without administrator rights, which makes pycript perfect to carry around sensible information on a USB stick.
